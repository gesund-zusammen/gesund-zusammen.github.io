Cookies sind kleine Textdateien, die entweder vorübergehend für die Dauer einer Sitzung (Session-Cookies) oder dauerhaft (permanente Cookies) auf Ihrem Endgerät gespeichert werden. Session-Cookies werden nach Ende Ihres Besuchs automatisch gelöscht. Permanente Cookies bleiben auf Ihrem Endgerät gespeichert bis Sie diese selbst löschen oder eine automatische Lösung durch Ihren Webbrowser erfolgt.\\nCookies haben verschiedene Funktionen. Zahlreiche Cookies sind technisch notwendig, da bestimmte Webseitenfunktionen ohne diese nicht funktionieren würden (z.B. die Warenkorbfunktion oder Spracheinstellungen). Andere Cookies dienen dazu, das Nutzerverhalten auszuwerten oder Werbung anzuzeigen.\\n\\nTechnisch notwendige Cookies werden auf Grundlage von Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO gespeichert. Wir haben ein berechtigtes Interesse an der Speicherung von Cookies zur technisch fehlerfreien und optimierten Bereitstellung unserer Dienste. Andere Cookies werden nur mit Ihrer Einwilligung auf Grundlage von Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO gespeichert. Die Einwilligung ist jederzeit für die Zukunft widerrufbar.

(„Google“). Google Analytics verwendet sogenannte Cookies. Das sind Textdateien, die auf Ihrem Computer gespeichert werden und die eine Analyse der Benutzung der Website durch Sie ermöglichen. Die durch das Cookie erzeugten Informationen über Ihre Benutzung dieser Website werden in der Regel an einen Server von Google in den USA übertragen und dort gespeichert. Wir setzen Google Analytics nur mit aktivierter IP-Anonymisierung ein. Das bedeutet, die IP-Adresse der Nutzer wird von Google innerhalb von Mitgliedstaaten der Europäischen Union oder in anderen Vertragsstaaten des Abkommens über den Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum gekürzt, wodurch eine Personenbeziehbarkeit ausgeschlossen werden kann. Google ist für das US-europäische Datenschutzübereinkommen „Privacy Shield“ zertifiziert, welches die Einhaltung des in der EU geltenden Datenschutzniveaus gewährleistet. Soweit Sie hierzu Ihre Einwilligung nach Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. a DSGVO erteilt haben, erfolgt die Verarbeitung auf dieser Website zum Zweck der Websiteanalyse. Im Auftrag des Betreibers dieser Website wird Google diese Informationen benutzen, um Ihre Nutzung der Website auszuwerten, um Reports über die Websiteaktivitäten zusammenzustellen und um weitere mit der Websitenutzung und der Internetnutzung verbundene Dienstleistungen gegenüber dem Websitebetreiber zu erbringen. Die im Rahmen von Google Analytics von Ihrem Browser übermittelte IP-Adresse wird nicht mit anderen Daten von Google zusammengeführt. Die Nutzungsbedingungen von Google Analytics und Informationen zum Datenschutz können über die folgenden Links abgerufen werden: http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html sowie unter https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/.\\n\\nSie können die Speicherung der Cookies durch eine entsprechende Einstellung Ihrer Browser-Software verhindern; wir weisen Sie jedoch darauf hin, dass Sie in diesem Fall gegebenenfalls nicht sämtliche Funktionen dieser Website vollumfänglich nutzen können. Sie können darüber hinaus die Erfassung der durch das Cookie erzeugten und auf Ihre Nutzung der Website bezogenen Daten (inkl. Ihrer IP-Adresse) an Google sowie die Verarbeitung dieser Daten durch Google verhindern, indem Sie das unter der URL [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de)\\nverfügbare Browser-Plug-in herunterladen und installieren.\\nEin Klick auf folgenden Link verhindert die Erfassung durch Google Analytics, indem ein sogenanntes Opt-out-Cookie gesetzt wird: Deaktivierung von Google Analytics\\nInformationen zum Umgang mit Nutzerdaten bei Google Analytics finden Sie in der Datenschutzerklärung von Google:\\n[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de)\\n\\n## Goolge Web Fonts\\n\\n(1) Wir verwenden auf unserem Internetauftritt \\\"Google Web Fonts\\\", einen Dienst der Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (nachfolgend bezeichnet als: \\\"Google\\\").

Dazu wird beim Abrufen unseres Internetauftritts die benötigten Google Fonts von Ihrem Webbrowser in ihren Browsercache geladen. Dies ist notwendig damit auch ihr Browser eine optisch verbesserte Darstellung unserer Texte anzeigen kann. Wenn ihr Browser diese Funktion nicht unterstützt, wird eine Standardschrift von ihrem Computer zur Anzeige genutzt. Die Einbindung dieser Web Fonts erfolgt durch einen Serveraufruf, in der Regel ein Server von Google in den USA. Hierdurch wird an den Server übermittelt, welche Seite unseres Internetauftritts Sie besucht haben. Auch wird die IP-Adresse des Browsers des Endgerätes des Besuchers von Google gespeichert.\\n(2) Wir verwenden Google Web Fonts zu Optimierungszwecken, insbesondere um die Nutzung unseres Internetauftritts für Sie zu verbessern und um dessen Ausgestaltung nutzerfreundlicher zu machen.\\n(3) Hierin liegt auch unser berechtigtes Interesse nach Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO.\\n(4) Google hat sich dem zwischen der Europäischen Union und den USA geschlossenen Privacy-Shield-Abkommen unterworfen und sich zertifiziert. Dadurch verpflichtet sich Google, die Standards und Vorschriften des europäischen Datenschutzrechts einzuhalten.

Diese Website nutzt aus Gründen der Sicherheit und zum Schutz der Übertragung vertraulicher Inhalte eine SSL-Verschlüsselung.\\n\\n## Dauer der Speicherung personenbezogener Daten\\n\\nDie Dauer der Speicherung von personenbezogenen Daten bemisst sich an den einschlägigen gesetzlichen Aufbewahrungsfristen (z. B. aus dem Handelsrecht und dem Steuerrecht). Nach Ablauf der jeweiligen Frist werden die entsprechenden Daten routinemäßig gelöscht.
