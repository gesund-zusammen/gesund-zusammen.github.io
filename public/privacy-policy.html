<h4>4. Google Analytics</h4>
<p>Our Website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (hereinafter “<strong>Google</strong>”). Google Analytics uses “cookies” to help analyzing how users use the Website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website (including your truncated IP-adress as described below) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google is <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI">certified</a> under the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en">EU-US-Privacy Shield</a>, so that an adequate level of data protection according to Art. 45 GDPR is ensured.</p>
<p>As IP-anonymisation is activated on our Website, your IP address will be truncated within the area of Member States of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases the whole IP address will be first transferred to a Google server in the USA and truncated there.</p>
<p>Google will use this information on behalf of finleap for the purpose of evaluating your use of our Website, compiling reports on website activity and providing us other services relating to website activity and internet usage. The collection and processing of your personal data is accordingly based on finleap’s legitimate interest in a demand-oriented design as well as the statistical evaluation of our website and the fact that your legitimate interests do not outweigh, Art. 6 Para. 1 f) GDPR.<br />
The IP-address, that your browser conveys within the scope of Google Analytics, will not be associated with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this Website.

<h4>5. Social Media</h4>
<p>We are active on Social Media for marketing reasons and to inform you about current news, events and to send you other information that may be of interest to you. Furthermore, we inform you about news and products of our portfolio companies. For sharing information from our Website on Social Media we do not use scripted Social Media plugins. Instead, our share buttons only contain a link to the Social Media (f.e. sharer.php for Facebook). This ensures that your data such as your (possibly truncated) IP address, entire cookies or other information will only be transmitted to the Social Media and thus possibly also to servers in the USA if and when you press the corresponding button yourself. The same applies to the links to our Social Media sites we have implemented on our Website. It is possible that a Social Media provider can associate your visit to our Services with your user account if you are logged into your Social Media account.</p>
<p>We have no influence on the amount and extent of data processed by the provider of the Social Media when you press a share button or click on the corresponding link and access the Social Media site, and therefore only inform you according to our level of knowledge. As soon as you access the Social Media site, the terms and conditions and the privacy policy of the respective provider of the Social Media apply.</p>

<h4>7. Change of Purpose</h4>
<p>We will only process your personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected if permitted by law or if you have consented to the changed purpose of data processing. In this case we will inform you about these other purposes before further processing and provide you with all other relevant information.</p>
<h4>8. Duration of Storage and Deletion of your Data</h4>
<p>If your personal data are no longer required for the aforementioned purposes or you revoke your consent on which the data processing is based, they will be deleted. If the data must be kept for legal reasons, they will be blocked in this respect. The data is then no longer available for further use.</p>
<p>We will store the personal data we receive in the recruitment process for a period of 12 months for preventive reasons.</p>
<h4>9. Your Rights</h4>
<p>As a person affected by the processing of personal data, you have the rights granted in Articles 15 to 21 GDPR and listed below for information purposes. If you wish to exercise your rights or receive information on data protection, you can contact us or our Data protection officer by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@finleap.com">privacy@finleap.com</a> or by using the other contact options listed in section 1 above.</p>

<h4>9.2. Right of Access</h4>
<p>In accordance with Art. 15 GDPR, you have the right to request confirmation from finleap as to whether personal data relating to you is processed; if this is the case, you have the right to receive information free of charge, in particular on the personal data stored about you and a copy of this information.<br />

<h4>9.4. Right to Erasure</h4>
<p>In accordance with Art. 17 GDPR, you have the right to request finleap to delete your personal data without delay. Deleting your data has the effect that finleap’s Services can no longer be used in full extend or used at all.</p>
<p>finleap is obliged to delete personal data immediately if processing is not necessary and if one of the following reasons applies:<br />
&#8211; The personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.<br />
<strong>&#8211; You have withdrawn your consent on which the processing was based and there is no other legal basis for the processing.</strong><br />
&#8211; You have lodged an objection to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for processing or you have lodged an objection to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 Para. 2 GDPR.<br />
&#8211; The personal data have been processed unlawfully.<br />
&#8211; Deleting your personal data is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation under German or European law.</p>

The measures shall only be taken in so far as processing is not necessary.</p>
<h4>9.5. Right to Restriction of Processing</h4>
<p>In accordance with Art. 18 GDPR, you have the right to request finleap to restrict processing if one of the following conditions is fulfilled:<br />
&#8211; You have disputed the accuracy of your personal data for a period that enables finleap to check the accuracy of your personal data.<br />
&#8211; The processing is unlawful and you have refused to delete your personal data and have instead requested a restriction on the use of your personal data.<br />
&#8211; finleap no longer needs your personal data for processing purposes, but you do need them to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.<br />
&#8211; You have filed an objection to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR and it is not clear yet whether our legitimate interests outweigh yours.</p>
<p>If the processing of personal data has been restricted in accordance with the conditions above, such data may only be processed &#8211; apart from being stored &#8211; with your consent or for the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending rights or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or on grounds of an important public interest of the Union or a Member State.<br />
If the processing is restricted, finleap will inform you before the restriction is lifted.</p>
<h4>9.6. Right to Object</h4>
<p><strong>According to Art. 21 GDPR, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data form-free and at any time, if your personal data is processed</strong><br />
<strong>a) on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 f) GDPR, or</strong><br />

<h4>9.7. Right to Data Portability</h4>
<p>According to Art. 20 GDPR, you have the right to receive your personal data which you have provided to finleap in a structured, common and machine-readable format.<br />
