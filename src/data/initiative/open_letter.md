**Abstract**: The announcement that Apple and Google are collaborating to work on a contact
tracing technology to reduce the spread of Covid- 19 poses many serious questions about data
privacy. The assistance provided by Apple and Google adding direct device level support for
bluetooth contact tracing is needed to increase accuracy and robustness, and is indeed welcome.
However, the main concern lies within the structure of the trust centers, and the ultimate cryptographic
control and transparency of the keys shared between devices. While the main aim of covid-19 tracing
is about saving lives, adding a secure and trusted framework such as the PEPP-PT can achieve
improved governance, transparency and speed to wide-scale adoption.

The current Covid-19 crisis has placed
many governments under strain to
protect and provide for their citizens. Many
governments have turned to technology to
help alleviate the burden. Digital tracing of
contact between citizens is one proven
way of fighting the rapid spread of
Covid-19, allowing for swift actions
once infections are discovered.

However, the possible implications of
creating and recommending the use of such
systems to citizens should not be
overlooked. Contact tracing requires
citizens to, depending on the architecture of
the system, record a list of all other citizens
they interact with. This information is highly
private, and its exploitation could set the
stage for large-scale manipulation in
the future. When viewed in isolation, one
could argue that contact data does not pose
a real threat to the privacy of our citizens
and the sovereignty of our nations.
Particularly when viewed in the light of
citizens losing their lives from Covid19 on
a daily basis.

This highlights the urgent need for a
thorough discussion around the
governance, transparency and motives of
this data now and, more importantly, into
the future.

This issue is complex, as many players
will need to do their part to ensure the
safety of citizens including device
functionality etc. However, who is allowed to
own and control certain parts of the process
will set the stage for how the use of
such data will evolve into the future.

Shedding light on the risk of allowing this
data to be manipulated in future, highlights
the risk of not taking action now. No
example rings more true than that of
Apple and Google. This paper's intent is to
provide constructive feedback for
consideration with the aim of reaching
a robust, private and effective Covid
tracing ecosystem that has data privacy
baked into the DNA of the architecture from
the start.

### The risks of the Apple and Google partnership: our data

Apple and Google have announced a
partnership to assist/conduct tracing of
citizen contact to help fight the spread of
Covid-19. This commitment to saving lives
is greatly appreciated by all nations,
organizations and communities.

While the specifics of the
implementations are not yet fully clear, and
hence cannot be analyzed in detail.
There are many questions around
transparency, control and use of the
data within their ecosystem. Despite
claims around privacy of the system,
the fact that Apple and Google
themselves will be the overall system owner
will make it difficult to get
transparency about how the data is used
now, and in the future.

To highlight the importance of reviewing
this addition, one can analyze what they
already have and what that gives them the
ability to do.

Google and Apple likely control or
have access to:

1. Devices (iPhone & Pixel etc). Thesedevices get additional information through
   a. Telematics
   b. Wifi signals
   c. GPS
   d. Installed Apps
   e. Sim card information
1. Operating Systems (iOS & Android dominate ​ **99%** of the world’s phones [1])
1. Browsers ( ​ **86%** are Google’s Chrome and Apple’s Safari[2])
1. Mail Clients ( ​ **74%** using either Apple or Google’s email services[3])
   1. Home Assistants (Google assistant is owning ​ **43%** ​ of the market[4])
   1. Search Engines (Google dominates the search engine ,market with ​ **92%** market share[5])
   1. Wearables (the major players are Apple [37%] and FitBit [24%][6]. FitBit was acquired by Google in 2019)

The level of market domination by these two
companies is clear. Both companies have
massive amounts of data and information
from these sources. The data is conveyed
through complex supply chains of devices,
tracking and monitoring software, and
ecosystems of apps and companies that
specialize in niche data flows captured.

With this data, and rapidly advancing AI
abilities they are able to create information
such as:

1. Who you are visiting and working with
1. Where you stay, for how long
1. Where you work
1. What you are interested in
1. What your habits are. Do you run, game, horse ride
1. Who you are emailing/speaking to
1. What you are buying
1. What you are saying around your devices
1. Even how you look with facial recognition capabilities[7]

This, coupled with the access to each user
via their devices, gives massive power to
manipulate the economy, our society and
even our lives, endangering not just
individual privacy but democracy itself. It
recalls a pre-Gutenberg era of extreme
asymmetries of knowledge and the power
that accrues to such knowledge, as the tech
giants seize control of information and
learning itself. In short, vast information will
be concentrated in the hands of a a few (in
this case, two) very powerful private
organizations.

Given Apple and Google’s dominance in
the mobile phone market, some may view
it to be their duty to support
robust interoperability between their
market dominating operating systems
iOS and Android. Based on the currently
available documentation detailing the
proposed tracing frameworks by Apple
and Google, the following are
deemed to be considerations worth
discussing. It is also noted that with
dialogue, Apple and Google may be willing
to address these concerns.

The proposed method of generating private
identities for users of the APIs would allow
Apple and Google transparent access to
these identities. The privacy-focussed
design as depicted, may protect citizens
from third parties getting this data, but
the "middleman" remains Apple and
Google who still retain the ability to
connect the dots. In essence, if an entity
has the ability to identify users, it cannot
simultaneously be responsible for
annonymizing the users on a global scale.

A clear separation of powers and
responsibility is required to prevent the
potential for widescale abuse.

With these footholds, their algorithms could
begin to add even more layers of accuracy
to understanding our citizens, and
hence the possibility for greater levels of
manipulation. These new data points
open new doors to an unpredictable
future.

While it is not assumed that the ownership
and view of the user identities is held
maliciously, it is important to understand
the potential of what is capable and the
risks that this poses to governments and
society. This visibility allows them
the ability to simultaneously hold the
identity of the user, plus the anonymous
identity of the user. The two together
makes data anonymization obsolete.

It is currently not accurately specified in the
proposed documentation, but it must be
maintained that the trust servers and core
cryptographic identity be managed
separately from Apple and Google.
Included in this requirement should be the
ability to determine the details of the
tracing sensitivity and response based
on each server itself.

### What can be done about it?

In the context of Covid-19, and the
overall imperative of saving lives, the
response must remain pragmatic, even in
light of the overall backdrop of global
privacy and data control.

Apple and Google are definitely required to
come to the table with adding device
functionality to enable bluetooth tracing.
This is something that they have committed
to in the press releases, and will enable
tracing to be more effective.

However, the cryptographic control of the
trust center upon which the decryption of
the bluetooth contact IDs should take place,
and the ultimate control of transparency/use
of who was in touch with whom sits should
not be controlled by Apple or Google on a
global scale. This responsibility should
either sit with each individual government,
or with a neutral third party entirely.

There are technical solutions, which are
available such as PEPP-PT, that allow for a
combination of using Apple and
Google’s device based on Bluetooth
support, along with multiple separate
trust centers and user
identification ability that can be wholly
controlled by governments, independent
organizations or medical institutions.

This structure represents a
pseudo-decentralized end state in which
data and control is spread among multiple
responsible entities. The architecture
will also promote greater transparency,
allow for collective governance of
the powers associated with collecting
this data as well as not compromising
the tracing efficiency and coverage of the
world.

It is also critical to understand the
relative timelines involved in
implementing the Apple/Google solution
and the PEPP-PT solutions, and how they
can overlap for maximum positive benefit.
PEPP-PT is scheduled to be fully available
at a commercial level by end of April,
whereas the proposed additions by Apple
and Google will only be available to
developers in mid-May, likely leading to
production level apps in June onwards. This
means that PEPP-PT can go live, and later
be updated to harness the improved device
level functionality provided by Apple and
Google.

### Conclusion

The first data privacy debates in the late
19 90’s and early 2000’s have been lost to
the tech giants who declared their view on
data. Any claim about Government control
is nothing compared to what Google and
other "big techs" are up to. Google and
the other big data companies are creating
a wholly new genus of capitalism, which is
based on a new systemic and coherent
logic of widespread data accumulation.

Now is the time to have this debate about
how far the data monopolies will go
before we take action that may set the
course for the future. We must ask
ourselves: if a merger between two
companies within one state is blocked to
prevent exploitation of citizens then why
will we not stop Apple and Google from
adding another global business to their
empire?

We rely on Apple and Google to hear these
comments, and adjust to allow a
fair outcome.

If the digital future is to be our home, then
it is we who must make it so.

Europe is in a special position to stand as
our best hope in this historic global
challenge. Europe must take the torch
and forge a new path to a new home, or
risk leasing one from Apple and Google.
