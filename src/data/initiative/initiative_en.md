## #HealthyTogether

* #### An open initiative led by the digital economy

  As broad alliance of German tech companies, we want to actively help society, politics and business to contain COVID-19 with digital solutions. We build up on one of the most important resources available to the world today: **Information.**

  Data enables us to do research together, warn people, save lives. And yet, widespread use of data is not without risk: In the face of the crisis, there are growing voices in favour of sacrificing basic rights for the good of health.
  Together we will prove the case: **we can have both - infection control and data protection.** So that private things remain private.

  Even in times of crisis, people's freedom and personal rights are top priority for our technology.
