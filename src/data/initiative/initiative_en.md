## Join us in building a people-centered post-COVID digital world

Data enables us to do research together, warn people, save lives. And yet, widespread use of data is not without risk: In the face of the crisis, there are growing voices in favour of sacrificing basic rights for the good of health. Together we will prove the case: **we can have both - infection control and data protection**.

- ###### So that private things remain private.

  Even in times of crisis, people's freedom and personal rights are top priority for our technology.

- ###### To keep Europe healthy

  The Digital Tools supported in the Accelerator program are designed to help protect risk groups better and relieve the burden on the healthcare system.

- ###### To get the economy moving

  Technology can be employed to reduce health risks in companies and help boost economic activity again.
