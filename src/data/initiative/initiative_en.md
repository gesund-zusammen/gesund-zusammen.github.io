* ## #HealthyTogether

  ### an open initiative led by the digital economy

  As broad alliance of German tech companies, we want to actively help society, politics and business to contain COVID-19 with digital solutions. We build up on one of the most important resources available to the world today: **Information.**

  Data enables us to do research together, warn people, save lives. And yet, widespread use of data is not without risk: In the face of the crisis, there are growing voices in favour of sacrificing basic rights for the good of health.
  Together we will prove the case: **we can have both - infection control and data protection.** So that private things remain private.

  Even in times of crisis, people's freedom and personal rights are top priority for our technology.

  Technology can be employed to reduce health risks in companies and help boost economic activity again.
