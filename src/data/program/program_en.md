The FuturePerfect Accelerator is organized by TOA, wefox & finleap, with many leading ecosystem players (i.e. N26, BVDS, DeliveryHero, Celonis, Ada Health) supporting.

#### The name

FuturePerfect refers to the future perfect verb tense: an action completed in the future. When we use this tense, we are projecting ourselves forward into the future and looking back at something to be completed at some time later than now. An action plan to define what's to come.

#### The program offers:

- €20,000 of equity-free capital, no strings attached.
- Free resources (products & services) through the partners involved.
- 6 weeks of acceleration to develop your product, build partnerships and acquire customers & financing through access to our network.
- Access to mentors and experts for best-in-industry coaching.
