#### Future Perfect 

The Future Perfect Accelerator is organized by TOA, wefox & finleap, with many leading ecosystem players (i.e. N26, BVDS, DeliveryHero, Celonis, Ada Health) supporting.

<br />

#### The name

Future Perfect refers to the future perfect verb tense: an action completed in the future. When we use this tense, we are projecting ourselves forward into the future and looking back at something to be completed at some time later than now. An action plan to define what's to come.
