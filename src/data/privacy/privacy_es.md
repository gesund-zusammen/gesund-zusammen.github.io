## Definitions

In principle, our privacy policy should be simple and understandable for everyone. For this reason, our privacy policy generally uses the official terms of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The official definitions are explained in Art. 4 GDPR.

## Server-Logfiles

When you visit our website, it is technically necessary that data is transmitted to our web server via your internet browser. The following data is recorded during a running connection for communication between your internet browser and our web server:

- Visited domain<br />
- The date and time of the request<br />
- Page from which the file was requested<br />
- Access status (file transferred, file not found, etc.)<br />
- The web browser, system language, operating system and device type used<br />
- IP address of the requesting computer<br />
- The amount of data transferred<br />

We collect the listed data to ensure a smooth connection to the website and to enable a comfortable use of our website. In addition, the log file serves the purpose of evaluating system security and stability, as well as providing administrative functions. The legal basis for the temporary storage of data or log files is Art. 6 para. 1 (f) GDPR.

## Cookies

Our website uses so-called “cookies”. Cookies are small text files that are either temporarily stored on your end device for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies). Session cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Permanent cookies remain stored on your terminal device until you delete them yourself or an automatic solution is provided by your web browser.
Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary, as certain website functions would not work without them (e.g. the shopping basket function or language settings). Other cookies are used to evaluate user behavior or display advertising.

Technically necessary cookies are stored on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 (f) GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies for the technically error-free and optimised presentation of our services. Other cookies are only stored with your consent on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 (a) GDPR. This consent can be withdrawn at any time for the future. The legal basis may also result from Art. 6 para. 1 (b) GDPR if the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the request of the data subject.

Insofar as cookies are used for analysis purposes, we will inform you of this separately within the framework of this privacy policy and obtain your consent.

Either do it directly via our [Cookie Settings](#uc-central-modal-show) option or you can set your browser to

- be informed about the setting of cookies,
- only allow cookies in individual cases,
- exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or generally,
- activate the automatic deletion of cookies when the browser is closed.

The cookie settings can be managed under the following links for each browser:

- [Google Chrome](http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=de&hlrm=en&answer=95647)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/cookies-erlauben-und-ablehnen)

You can also manage cookies of many companies and functions used for advertising individually. To do this, use the appropriate user tools, available at [https://www.aboutads.info/choices/](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or [http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices).
Most browsers also offer a so-called "do-not-track function". When this feature is enabled, the browser tells ad networks, websites, and applications that you do not want to be "tracked" for behavioral advertising and the like.

For information and instructions on how to edit this feature, please refer to the links below, depending on your browser provider:

- [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2790761?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=de)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/de/firefox/dnt/)

- [Opera](http://help.opera.com/Windows/12.10/de/notrack.html)

Additionally, you can prevent the loading of so-called scripts by default. "NoScript" allows the execution of JavaScripts, Java and other plug-ins only at trusted domains of your choice. Information and instructions on how to edit this function can be obtained from the provider of your browser (e.g. for Mozilla Firefox at: [https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/noscript/](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/noscript/)).

## Goolge Web Fonts

This site uses web fonts provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland ("Google") to uniformly display fonts. Google Web Fonts allows us to use external fonts, so-called Google Fonts. When you visit our website, the required Google Font is loaded from your web browser into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly. This is necessary so that your browser can also show an optically improved representation of our texts. If your browser does not support this feature, your computer will use a standard font for display. These web fonts are integrated by a server call, usually a Google server in the USA. This transfers to the server which page of our website you have visited. Google also stores the IP address of the browser of the visitor's terminal device.
We use Google Web Fonts for optimization purposes, in particular to improve the use of our Internet presence for you and to make its design more user-friendly. This is also our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1(f) GDPR.
Google has signed and certified itself under the Privacy Shield Agreement between the European Union and the USA. By doing so, Google undertakes to comply with the standards and regulations of European data protection law.
