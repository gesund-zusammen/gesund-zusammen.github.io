          While visiting our website and if you do not register for our
          newsletter or contact us via our contact form, we only collect the
          data that your browser transmits to our server.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          This is the following information required to display our website to
          you and to ensure stability and security: IP address, date and time of
          the request, content of the request (specific page), access
          status/HTTP status code, amount of data transferred in each case,
          website from which the request comes, browser, operating system and
          its interface, language and version of the browser software. Please
          note that we cannot draw any conclusions about individual persons on
          the basis of this data.

        <Typography variant="body1">
          The data is stored by us for technical security reasons, e.g. to
          prevent attacks on our web server; however, the data is anonymized
          after seven days at the latest by shortening the IP address at domain
          level, so that it is no longer possible to establish any reference to
          the individual website user. The legal basis for the processing
          described above is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR (processing
          is necessary in relation with controller’s legitimate interests).

          For the registration to our newsletter we have implemented the
